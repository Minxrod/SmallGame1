# SmallGame1
A small "game" created in less than an hour.
This is practice for both using Git/GitHub more, and just practicing random Java things.

# Controls
Build, run, etc.
Type the text that appears. You earn more points the more correct you get in a row.
Zoom in/out using page-up and page-down.

# Note
Game never ends. :)
Just close it when you're done.
This is pretty much a tech demo.
